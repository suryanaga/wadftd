This repository contains custom JavaScript used to power the interactive pledge experience on the [FutureDharma](https://futuredharma.org) website.

Itâ€™s designed to work within a Webflow environment, enhancing user interaction with:
- A step-by-step pledge calculator
- Dynamic allocation of donations across multiple charities
- Drag-and-drop and slider-based donation splits
- Live updating of totals and summary display
- Conditional logic based on user selections (e.g., Order member status)
